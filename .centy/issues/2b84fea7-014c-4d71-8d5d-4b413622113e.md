# Add CLI commands for link management

Merged from #151 and #157.

## Summary

The link feature is fully implemented in the daemon and gRPC API (CreateLink, DeleteLink, ListLinks, GetAvailableLinkTypes), but the CLI has no commands to expose it. Need to add commands for creating, deleting, listing links, and displaying them in existing output.

## Commands to implement

### Create links

```bash
centy link issue <issue-number> --<link-type> <target-type>:<target-id>
centy link doc <slug> --<link-type> <target-type>:<target-id>
```

### Remove links

```bash
centy unlink issue <issue-number> <target-type>:<target-id> [--type <link-type>]
centy unlink doc <slug> <target-type>:<target-id> [--type <link-type>]
```

### List links

```bash
centy links issue <issue-number>
centy links doc <slug>
```

### List available link types

```bash
centy list link-types
```

## Example usage

```bash
# Issue 1 blocks issue 2
centy link issue 1 --blocks issue:2

# Doc links to related issue
centy link doc getting-started --relates-to issue:5

# Remove link
centy unlink issue 1 issue:2

# List links
centy links issue 1

# List available link types
centy list link-types
```

## Display links in existing output

Links should also be shown in the output of `get issue`, `get doc`, and `show` commands so users can see relationships without running a separate command.

## Files to create

- src/commands/link/index.ts
- src/commands/unlink/index.ts
- src/commands/list/links.ts
- src/commands/list/link-types.ts
- src/daemon/daemon-create-link.ts
- src/daemon/daemon-delete-link.ts
- src/daemon/daemon-list-links.ts
- src/daemon/daemon-get-available-link-types.ts

## Notes

- Use existing gRPC Link RPCs (CreateLink, DeleteLink, ListLinks, GetAvailableLinkTypes)
- Support custom link types from project config
- Display bidirectional link info
- PRs have been removed from the codebase; link targets are issues and docs only
