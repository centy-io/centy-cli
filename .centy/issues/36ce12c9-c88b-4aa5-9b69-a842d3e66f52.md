# Organization filter dropdown extends beyond its container width

The organization filter dropdown in the header extends too far to the right, overlapping with the project selector area. The dropdown should be constrained to align with its trigger button but instead extends significantly beyond its expected bounds.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Dropdown should be constrained to a reasonable width
- Should not overlap with adjacent UI elements (project selector)
- Should align properly with its trigger button

**Current Behavior:**

- Dropdown extends too far to the right
- Overlaps with the project selector dropdown area

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open the centy app
1. Click on the organization selector dropdown in the header
1. Observe dropdown extends beyond expected container width

**Suggested Fix:**
Consider adding max-width on the dropdown container or adjusting positioning.
