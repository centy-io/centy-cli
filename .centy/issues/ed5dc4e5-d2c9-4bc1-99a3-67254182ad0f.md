# Support `edit` as an alias for `update` command

Add `centy edit issue` as an alias for `centy update issue` so users can use either `centy update issue` or `centy edit issue` interchangeably. This improves discoverability since “edit” is a natural verb users may reach for when wanting to modify an issue.
