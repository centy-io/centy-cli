# Remove TUI from centy-cli

Remove the embedded TUI (Text User Interface) from the centy-cli project.

## Background

The centy-cli currently includes a TUI implementation at `src/tui/` that provides an interactive terminal interface. This TUI should be removed as there is already a separate `centy-tui` Rust project for terminal UI functionality.

## Scope

The following should be removed:

- `src/tui/` directory and all its contents (components, hooks, services, utils, types)
- TUI-related dependencies from package.json (@opentui/\*, ink, react for TUI, etc.)
- TUI configuration from tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts, knip.json
- TUI documentation (`.centy/docs/tui-guide.md`)
- TUI assets (assets/tui.png)
- Any TUI-related commands or entry points in bin/run.js

## Benefits

- Reduced bundle size and dependencies
- Single source of truth for TUI functionality (centy-tui Rust project)
- Simplified centy-cli codebase focused on CLI commands
