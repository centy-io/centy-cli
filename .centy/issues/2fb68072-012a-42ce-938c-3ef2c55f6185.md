# Consolidate CLI delete commands to use generic DeleteItem RPC

The proto layer already defines a generic DeleteItem RPC and all specific delete methods (DeleteIssue, DeleteDoc, DeleteAsset, DeleteOrganization, DeleteUser) are marked as deprecated in favor of it. However, the CLI still has 5 separate delete command files (delete/asset.ts, delete/doc.ts, delete/issue.ts, delete/org.ts, delete/user.ts) each calling the old specific RPCs. Consolidate these to use the generic DeleteItem endpoint to reduce duplicated boilerplate.
