# Notify users of newer prerelease versions during install

When running `centy install`, if the user has a prerelease version installed (e.g., v0.2.0-alpha.9) and there’s a newer prerelease available, we should notify them.

**Current Behavior:**

- The install command only checks for newer stable releases

**Expected Behavior:**

- If the user is on a prerelease version, check for newer prereleases as well
- Display a message like: “A newer prerelease version is available: v0.2.0-alpha.10 (you have v0.2.0-alpha.9)”
- This should respect the `--prerelease` flag behavior

**Example:**

```
$ centy install
Note: A newer prerelease version is available: v0.2.0-alpha.10
      Run 'centy install --prerelease' to upgrade
```
