# Restore test coverage thresholds to 80% and enforce in pre-push hook

## Problem

Test coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts were temporarily lowered from 80% to 40% (lines), 45% (functions), 25% (branches), and 40% (statements). This weakens confidence in code quality.

## Requirements

- Restore all coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts to 80% (lines, functions, branches, statements)
- Add coverage validation to the Husky pre-push hook so pushes are blocked if coverage drops below 80%
- Ensure the daemon layer, PR creation, and autostart modules are either covered or explicitly justified for exclusion
- Remove or update any comments about temporarily lowered thresholds
