# Support `npx centy version` syntax for showing CLI version

Currently, `centy --version` / `centy -v` (handled in bin/run.js) shows the CLI version and daemon status, while `centy version` is an oclif command that shows project version comparison with the daemon. Users familiar with tools like `docker version`, `npm version`, or `kubectl version` may expect `centy version` to display the CLI’s own version.

The existing `centy version` command should also include the CLI version in its output (alongside the project/daemon comparison), so that `npx centy version` serves as a complete version overview.

### Current behavior

- `centy --version` shows: CLI version + daemon version/status
- `centy version` shows: project version + daemon version + comparison status (no CLI version)

### Expected behavior

`centy version` should include the CLI version in its output, e.g.:

```
CLI: 0.3.0
Project Version: 1.0.0
Daemon Version: 1.0.0
Status: Up to date
```

### Suggested approach

Update `src/commands/version.ts` to read the CLI version from `package.json` and include it in the output (both plain text and JSON modes).
