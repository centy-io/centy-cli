# Replace custom toPlural utility with a pluralization library

Replace the hand-rolled toPlural function in src/utils/to-plural.ts with a well-tested pluralization library (e.g., pluralize). The current implementation only handles three cases (words ending in s, y, and everything else), which will break for irregular plurals like person to people, child to children, or status to statuses.

## Current state

- src/utils/to-plural.ts has a naive 3-rule pluralization function
- Used by src/commands/create.ts and src/commands/get.ts to convert singular item type names to plural

## Implementation

1. Add a pluralization library (e.g., pluralize npm package) as a dependency
1. Replace the body of toPlural in src/utils/to-plural.ts to delegate to the library
1. Update src/utils/to-plural.spec.ts to cover irregular plural cases
1. Remove the manual pluralization rules
